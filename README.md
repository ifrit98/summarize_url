# summarize_url
Summarize using langchain.  Specifically for PDFs but works with all unstructured text.

This script downloads a PDF file from a given URL, splits the file into smaller chunks, and generates a summary of its contents using a pre-trained language model.
Requirements

    Python 3.x
    Jina
    OpenAI API key (optional)

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    shell

$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
$ cd your-repo

Install the required packages:

ruby

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

vbnet

usage: pdf_summarizer.py [-h] [--max_tokens MAX_TOKENS] url file_name summary_out [--recursive_text_splitter]

Download a PDF from a URL and generate a summary of its contents.

positional arguments:
  url                   The URL of the PDF file to download.
  file_name             The name to use for the downloaded PDF file.
  summary_out           The path to save the generated summary.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --max_tokens MAX_TOKENS
                        The maximum number of tokens to use for the summary. (default: 1024)
  --recursive_text_splitter
                        Whether to use a recursive text splitter to split the document into smaller chunks. (default: False)

To use the script, simply provide the URL of the PDF file to download, the name to use for the downloaded file, and the path where the generated summary should be saved. You can also optionally specify the maximum number of tokens to use for the summary using the --max_tokens argument, and whether to use a recursive text splitter to split the document into smaller chunks using the --recursive_text_splitter argument.
Example

To generate a summary of a PDF file located at https://example.com/myfile.pdf and save the summary to summary.txt, you can run the following command:

ruby

$ python pdf_summarizer.py https://example.com/myfile.pdf myfile.pdf summary.txt --max_tokens 512 --recursive_text_splitter

This will download the PDF file from the URL, split it into smaller chunks using a recursive text splitter, generate a summary using a pre-trained language model with a maximum of 512 tokens, and save the summary to summary.txt.

And here is the textfile:
